# types

If you think that defrecord is great and you want the same for vectors and sets, you're in the right place.

Alpha quality, contributions are welcome

## Declaration 

```clojure
;; def a new type called Foo that behave exactly like a PersistentVector
(vectype Foo)

;; it can be extended to whatever protocol you need to implement
(vectype FOO 
  IBark 
  (bark [_] "woaf"))
```


## Instantiate

```clojure
;; unary constructor
(foo [1 2 3])

;; variadic constructor
(foo* 1 2 3)

;; if those contructor names doesn't suits you, you can rename it
(vectype Foo 
  {:cfnsym build-foo
   :cfnsym* foo}
  ;; your protocol impls 
)

;;then
(build-foo [1 2 3])
(foo 1 2 3) 

```

## Sets

For set like type you can use `settype` instead of `vectype`

That's all
